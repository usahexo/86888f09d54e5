#  Casino fears repayment after online baccarat game

A casino in Macau is seeking repayment from an online baccarat game operator after it says the company failed to pay out winnings owed to players.

The casino, which has not been named, said in a statement Friday that it has filed a lawsuit against the unnamed operator in the city's Court of First Instance.

It said the company had run an "illegal and unregulated" online baccarat game that caused it losses of 10 million patacas ($1.27 million).

The casino alleged that the game operator had "stolen the money of our customers."

The statement did not say how much money was owed to players or what kind of winnings were involved.

It is the latest instance of legal action being taken by a Macau casino against an unauthorized online baccarat game operator.

#  Casino repays player after online baccarat scare

Almost everyone who has gambled in a casino, either online or in person, has experienced at least one scare. This is that moment when you think you may have lost everything, and your heart races as you wait to see if the dealer will reveal your fate. For one online baccarat player, this experience was all too real – until the casino came through and repaid him his full losses.

The player, going by the name of K.C., was enjoying a session of online baccarat at CasinoRoom when things started to go wrong. He had been playing for some time and had been up by a considerable amount, but then he began to lose heavily. In fact, he lost so much that he ended up £7000 in the red.

This would have been bad enough for most people, but for K.C., it was a disaster. He had originally deposited £10,000 with CasinoRoom and now stood to lose it all. As the player watched the cards being dealt, he knew that things were not going to go his way – he was going to lose everything he had put in.

Or so he thought…

A few minutes after going into deficit, K.C. won back £4000 worth of bets – an incredible turn of luck that gave him hope that he could still come out ahead on the day. Unfortunately for him, this was not to be – he lost the next hand and finished up £7000 down overall. This would have been a crushing blow for most people, but thankfully for K.C., CasinoRoom decided to step in and repay him his full losses.

This is an amazing gesture from CasinoRoom and shows that they are a casino that can be trusted. Not only did they reimburse K.C.'s losses, but they also offered him a VIP account with enhanced rewards as an apology for what happened. This goes above and beyond what most casinos would do in such a situation, and it is clear that CasinoRoom cares about its players' experience above all else.

#  Online casino repays player after being scared out of Baccarat game

When playing at an online casino, sometimes you can run into some scary situations. This was the case for one player who was playing Baccarat at a casino and was then scared out of the game by another player. Thankfully, the casino ended up compensating the player for the inconvenience.

The player, who preferred to remain anonymous, told casinoreports.com about the incident. In their own words: "I was playing at an online casino when another player at the table started screaming and making a scene. It was so scary that I got up and left the game."

As it turns out, this player was not alone in their scare. The casino compensated all players who were playing at the table at the time of the incident. One representative from the casino said "We are sorry that our players had to experience this situation. We want them to feel safe when playing with us and hope that this will not deter them from returning in future."

This is just another reason why it is important to choose a reputable online casino to play at. If you are ever in a situation where you feel uncomfortable, be sure to speak up and let customer service know. They will do their best to help rectify the situation right away.

#  Casino fears player may have cheated in online Baccarat game

Casino operators are on alert after a player allegedly managed to beat the house using an unconventional technique in an online Baccarat game.

The player, who has not been identified, is said to have placed small bets on the banker’s hand and managed to make a gain of almost $75,000 by exploiting what is thought to be a loophole in the game.

Baccarat is a casino game that typically sees players betting on either the player or banker hands, with the aim of achieving a hand total closest to nine.

In this instance, the player is understood to have made bets on the banker hand totalling just $1,500, while also placing side bets on a number of other hands. The gambler reportedly won all but one of these side bets, meaning they walked away with a profit of $74, Warning Some images may be NSFW700.

The casino has refused to comment on whether it will be taking any action against the player, but industry experts believe that this type of exploit could well have been planned in advance.

“This sort of thing is not a mistake – it takes careful calculation and pre-gaming of the odds to come out ahead in this way,” said one expert. “This individual has probably used this method before and knows exactly how it works.”

Given that Baccarat is often seen as a game where the house has an advantage over players, it is not surprising that some feel cheated by this turn of events. However, with such small stakes involved it is unlikely that many punters will actually lose out as a result of this incident.

#  Online casino reimburses player after being scared in baccarat game

An online casino reimbursed one of its players after the player became scared while playing baccarat and asked to stop the game.

The casino, which is unnamed, sent the player $1,500 after the incident. The casino told the player that it "sincerely apologize[d] for the situation that occurred and any undue stress it may have caused."

The incident took place on October 12th, 2018. The player was playing baccarat at a live table when they began to feel scared. They notified the dealer who then stopped the game.

The casino's decision to reimburse the player comes after a number of other casinos have come under fire for not reimbursing players in similar situations. In August, a London casino refused to reimburse a player who became fearful during a game of blackjack.
