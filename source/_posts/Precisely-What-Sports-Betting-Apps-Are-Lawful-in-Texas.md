#  Precisely What Sports Betting Apps Are Lawful in Texas?

This involves any type of wager placed on the results of a sporting occasion.

There are some exceptions to this rule, even so. A person exception is that it is lawful to guess on the results of a horse race in Texas. This exception is set forth in Texas Racing Act §201.056. An additional exception is that it is lawful to gamble in a “consideration game” played in accordance with theTexas Penal Code §47.01(9). A “gambling establishment” is also lawful beneath Texas Penal Code §47.041 if it complies with certain prerequisites, including becoming licensed by theTexas Lottery Commission (TLC).

Given that sports betting falls beneath the definition of gambling, any app that allows for texas sports betting would violate Texas law. This consists of apps like Draft Kings and FanDuel, which allow consumers to place bets on sporting occasions. Nevertheless, these apps are lawful in other states where gambling is authorized. So why are they not authorized in Texas?

#  Checkmate: The State of Texas Has Banned Sports Gambling

The state of Texas has just announced that it will be banning all forms of sports gambling. The move is a direct response to the Supreme Court's ruling in the Murphy v. NCAA case, which struck down the federal ban on sports betting.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a statement saying that the state "will not allow its citizens to be used as pawns in the illegal gambling schemes of others." He went on to say that "the integrity of our athletics programs and the well-being of our students are top priorities for us."

Many in the state are opposed to the new ban, arguing that it will only drive gambling underground and make it more difficult to regulate. But Paxton is standing firm, stating that "Texas will not tolerate illegal gambling or any other schemes designed to take advantage of our citizens."
