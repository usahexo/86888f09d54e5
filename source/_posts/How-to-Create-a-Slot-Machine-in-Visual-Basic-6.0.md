#  How to Create a Slot Machine in Visual Basic 6.0

In this article, we're going to show you how to create a slot machine in Visual Basic 6.0. This will be a basic slot machine that doesn't have any bells and whistles, but it will still be fun to play. Let's get started!

First, the basic components that we'll need for our slot machine are as follows:

One timer control
Six image buttons (one for each symbol on the reel)
One text box to display the results of the spin
One label to indicate how many credits are remaining
One button to start the game
One button to stop the game

We'll also need some code to simulate the spinning of the reel and to determine whether or not the player has won. The following is an outline of that code:

Private Sub SpinReel() Dim intResult As Integer intResult = CInt(Rnd() * 3) Select Case intResult Case 1 Image1.Picture = "Images/A.bmp" Case 2 Image1.Picture = "Images/B.bmp" Case 3 Image1.Picture = "Images/C.bmp" End Select End Sub Private Sub CheckWin() Dim intResult As Integer intResult = CInt(Rnd() * 3) Select Case intResult Case 1 MsgBox("You win!" & vbCrLf & "Amount: " & Credits) Case 2 MsgBox("You lose!" & vbCrLf & "Amount: " & Credits) Case Else MsgBox("Sorry, no winner this time.") End Select End Sub Private Sub cmdStart_Click() Timer1.Enabled = True SpinReel() End Sub Private Sub cmdStop_Click() Timer1.Enabled = False If CheckWin() Then MsgBox("You win!" & vbCrLf & "Amount: " & Credits) Else MsgBox("You lose!" & vbCrLf & "Amount: " & Credits) End If End Sub

This article will show you how to make a slot machine in VB6.0.

First, create a new project in VB6.0 and select Windows FormsApplication as the project type.

Next, add a button and three textboxes to the form. The textboxes will be used to display the results of the slot machine, while the button will be used to start the machine.

Now, add the following code to the form:

Private Sub Button1_Click() 
Randomize 
SlotMachine1.Start() 
End Sub

 Private Sub SlotMachine1_MouseDown(ByVal Button As Integer, ByVal Shift As Integer, ByVal x As Single, ByVal y As Single) 
Select Case Button 
Case 1 'Left mouse button pressed down
If SlotMachine1.Stop() Then 
MsgBox "You won't believe it! You've just won a fortune!!" & vbNewLine & _ "Amount: " & FormatNumber(SlotMachine1.Credits) & vbNewLine & "Games Played: " & FormatNumber(SlotMachine1.GamesPlayed), vbOKOnly + vbInformation, "Congratulations" 
ElseIf SlotMachine1.Credits > 0 Then 
MsgBox "You've just played " & FormatNumber(SlotMachine1.Credits) & " game(s)" & vbNewLine & _ "Current Prize: " & FormatNumber(SlotMachine1.Prize) & vbNewLine & _ "You can play again?" , vbYesNo + vbQuestion, "Play Again?" 
Else MsgBox "You have no credits left",vbOKOnly+vbExclamation,"Oops!" 
End If 
Case 2 'Right mouse button pressed down
Exit Sub 
End Select 
End Sub

Next, we need to add the following code to the procedure that is called when the mousebutton is pressed down:This code will determine which button has beenpressed and act accordingly.

#  Create a Slot Machine in Visual Basic 6.0 

Slot machines are a lot of fun. They're also pretty simple to make in Visual Basic 6.0. In this article, we'll create a very simple slot machine. The program will have five buttons: one for each reel. When the user presses one of the buttons, the corresponding reel will spin. If the reel lands on a winning symbol, the user wins and the program will print out a message telling them how much they have won.

To create our slot machine, we first need to create a new project in Visual Basic 6.0. We can do this by going to File > New > Project. We then need to select "Windows" from the list of projects and select "Dialog-based" from the type of project options. We then need to give our project a name and click on "OK".

Once our project has been created, we need to add two labels and five buttons to our form. To do this, we first need to select "Label" from the toolbox and then draw it onto our form. We can do this by going to View > Form Designer and then clicking on the button at the top-left corner of our form that says "Objects pallet"). We can then drag and drop a label onto our form. We can repeat this process four more times until we have five labels on our form.

With our labels in place, we now need to add our buttons. To do this, we first need to select "CommandButton" from the toolbox and then draw it onto our form. We can do this by going to View > Form Designer and then clicking on the button at the top-left corner of our form that says "Objects pallet"). We can then drag and drop a button onto each of our labels.

Once we have done this, we need to configure each of our buttons so that they correspond with the correct reel. To do this, we first need to double-click on each of our buttons so that we can edit their properties. We can do this by going to View > Properties Window or by pressing F4 on our keyboard. With the Properties Window open, we need to set the Name property of each button so that it corresponds with the relevant reel (iReel1, iReel2, iReel3, iReel4, iReel5). We also need to set the Caption property of each button so that it reads "Spin Reel 1", "Spin Reel 2", etc...

Once we have done this, we are ready to write our code! 

The code for our slot machine is relatively simple. We first need to declare some variables that will hold information about our game: 
Dim intWon As Integer 
Dim strMessage As String 
We also need some constants that will help us determine whether or not somebody has won: 
Public Const kWinningSymbol As String = "7" 
Public Const kLoseSymbol As String = "?" 
Public Const kMax Winnings As String = 100000 
We next need some subroutines that will help us manage our game: 

Sub SetButtons() 	With Me .iReel1 .Enabled = False 	With .iReel2 .Enabled = True 	End With 	With .iReel3 .Enabled = False 	With .iReel4 .Enabled = True 	End With 	With .iReel5 .Enabled = False End With End Sub

Sub ButtonClicked(ByVal Button As CommandButton) Dim intPos As Integer intPos = CInt(Timer()) + 1 If intPos > 4 Then intPos = 0 Select Case Button Case lblSpin1 'Do something when Spin 1 is clicked Case lblSpin2 'Do something when Spin 2 is clicked Case lblSpin3 'Do something when Spin 3 is clicked Case lblSpin4 'Do something when Spin 4 is clicked Case lblSpin5 'Do something when Spin 5 is clicked End Select End Sub

Now let's take a look at how each subroutine works:

Sub SetButtons() This subroutine simply sets all of the Buttons on our form so that they correspond with their appropriate reels. It does this by setting each Button's Enabled property accordingly: Me .iReel1 .Enabled = False Me .iReel2 .Enabled = True Me .iReel3 .Enabled = False Me .iReel4 .Enabled = True Me .iReel5 .Enabled = False End Sub

Sub ButtonClicked(ByVal Button As CommandButton) This subroutine simply prints out a message telling us which button was clicked: Dim intPos As Integer intPos = CInt(Timer

#  The Easiest Way to Create a Slot Machine in VB6.0 

Creating a slot machine like the ones you see in casinos is a popular project for beginners learning VB6.0. This is because it is relatively simple to do and can be accomplished in a few short steps. The following tutorial will show you the easiest way to create a slot machine in VB6.0.

1. First, you will need to create a new project in VB6.0 and select the Standard EXE option.

2. Once your new project has been created, you will need to add three buttons to your form – one each for betting, spinning, and winning.

3. Next, you will need to add the code that will power your slot machine. This code can be found below: 
Option Explicit
Private Sub Form_Load()
Me.Caption = "Slot Machine"
End Sub

Private Sub cmdBet_Click()
If (Me.Text = "20") Then
Me.Text = "10"
ElseIf (Me.Text = "50") Then
Me.Text = "25"
ElseIf (Me.Text = "100") Then
Me.Text = "50"
End If 
End Sub

Private Sub cmdSpin_Click() 
Dim result As Integer 
result = CInt(Rnd * 3) + 1  
If result > 2 Then 
MsgBox("You win!", vbOKOnly + vbInformation) 
 Me.Enabled = False 
ElseIf result = 1 Then 
MsgBox("You lose!", vbOKOnly + vbExclamation) 
 Me.Enabled = False 	Else Me.Enabled = True  End If 	End Sub

Private Sub cmdExit_Click() 
Unload Me  End Sub

#  How to Create an Amazing Slot Machine in VB6.0

Creating a slot machine game in Visual Basic 6.0 is a fun and easy way to learn the basics of programming. In this tutorial, we will create a simple three-reel slot machine.

To start, open up Visual Basic and create a new project. We will call our project “SlotMachine.”

Now, let’s add some basic code to our project. We will need three variables to keep track of our reel positions:

Public Reel1 As Integer
Public Reel2 As Integer
Public Reel3 As Integer

Next, we need to create a subroutine to update our reel positions:

Public Sub UpdateReels()
Reel1 = Int(Rnd * 3) + 1
Reel2 = Int(Rnd * 3) + 1
Reel3 = Int(Rnd * 3) + 1
End Sub

This subroutine will simply generate random numbers between 1 and 3, and then assign them to our reel positions. Next, we need to write the code that will actually run the slot machine. This code should go in the Form_Load event:

 Private Sub Form_Load() 
With Me  .'Create the objects we'll need Dim objSlotMachine As New clsSlotMachine()  .'Initialize the slot machine objSlot Machine .Init("")  .'Set up the buttons With Command1  .Caption = "Spin"  .Width = 85  .Height = 25  .Top = 20  .Left = 120 End With With Command2  .Caption = "Cash Out"  .Width = 85  .Height = 25  .Top =Command1.Top+Command1.Height+15  .Left =Command1.Left-Command1.Width-40 End With End With UpdateReels() End Sub

 In this code, we first create an object for our slot machine and then call its Init() method to set it up. We also create two buttons—one for spinning the reels and one for cashing out—and position them appropriately on our form. Finally, we call our UpdateReels() subroutine to update the reel positions every time the user clicks one of these buttons. That’s it! You now have a functioning slot machine game!

 To customize your game, you can change the values in the UpdateReels() subroutine to create different reel combinations. You can also add sound effects and graphics to give your game a more polished look. Have fun experimenting and see what you can come up with!
