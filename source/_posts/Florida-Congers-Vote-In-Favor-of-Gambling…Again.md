#  Florida Congers Vote In Favor of Gambling…Again

The Florida Legislature passed a gambling bill on Monday that will allow voters in the state to decide whether they want casinos. The vote was 74-42 in favor of the bill.

This is the second time in as many years that the Florida Legislature has voted in favor of gambling. However, this time around, there is a lot more at stake.

If the amendment passes in November, it would allow three resort casinos in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, along with slot machines at dog and horse tracks. There would also be one casino each in Palm Beach and Hillsborough counties.

The amendment needs 60% approval from voters to pass.

Gambling opponents are concerned about the social cost of gambling addiction, while supporters say that gambling will bring jobs and tourism to the state.

Similar amendments have failed in the past, but this time around there seems to be more momentum behind it. The Disney company has come out against the amendment, but Universal Studios is in favor of it.

#  Florida Continues to Support Gambling: This Time with a Majority

The Sunshine State has been a gambling mecca for years, with its world-famous casino resorts drawing people from all corners of the globe. But despite this, the state has never had legalized gambling until this year when Florida voters passed Amendment 3, which allows for slots and casino games at existing greyhound and horse racing tracks.

Interestingly, the vote was close, with only 52% in favor of the amendment. However, many believe that this is just the beginning, and that gambling will continue to be legalized in the state as Floridians see how it can benefit them economically.

In fact, some lawmakers are already considering expanding gambling even further. One proposal would allow for casinos to be built in eight specific counties – including Miami-Dade and Broward – while another would allow slot machines in bars and restaurants.

Despite any opposition to gambling expansion, it seems likely that Florida will continue to support it. After all, the state has a long history of gambling and its casinos are among some of the most popular in the world.

#  Florida Votes for Gambling, Again

 Florida voters have decided to legalize gambling once again. This will allow casino gambling in the state, which is expected to bring in a lot of money for the government.

There are many people who are in favor of this decision and believe that it will be good for the economy. There are also those who are opposed to it, citing concerns about addiction and its potential negative effects on families.

Supporters of gambling argue that it is a source of revenue that can be used to help fund important programs and services. They also say that it is a way to create jobs and bring in tourists.

Critics of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people. They also claim that it can hurt local businesses and that the money raised by casinos does not always go back into the community.

Despite these concerns, Florida voters have decided to legalize gambling once again. This will allow casinos to open up shop in the state and provide much-needed revenue for the government.

#  Majority of Florida Congers Vote in Favor of Casinos

A recent poll of Florida’s congressional districts showed that the majority of representatives are in favor of legalizing casinos in the state. The poll, which was conducted by the St. Pete Times, surveyed all 27 districts in Florida.

Of the lawmakers polled, 18 said they would support a casino bill, 4 said they were undecided, and only 5 were opposed to legalizing casinos. This comes as a bit of a surprise, as earlier polls showed that Floridians themselves were divided on the issue of casinos.

The support for casinos among Florida’s elected officials is likely due to the potential economic benefits that casinos could bring to the state. Casinos are known to generate substantial tax revenues, as well as create jobs.

In order for a casino bill to pass in Florida, it would need the support of two-thirds of the legislature. It is unclear at this point whether such a bill will be introduced during this year’s legislative session.

#  Florida Moves Closer to Legalizing Gambling as More Than Half of Congress Votes in Favor

Florida is one step closer to legalizing gambling after the state’s House of Representatives approved a bill that would allow for casino-style gaming in the state. The vote, which came on Tuesday, saw more than half of Congress voting in favor of the measure, paving the way for it to be signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis.

While there has been some opposition to the proposed law, with some arguing that it will lead to increased gambling addiction rates, others believe that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state. Gambling proponents argue that the industry will create jobs and generate tax revenue that can be used to support important social programs.

Under the proposed bill, Florida would become the latest in a growing number of states to legalize some form of casino-style gaming. If approved, casinos would be allowed to open in eight counties that have already been approved for horse racing. In addition, slots and other forms of electronic gaming would be permitted at pari-mutuel facilities throughout the state.

The move comes as Florida faces what is being described as a budget crisis. Last year, lawmakers were forced to approve cuts totaling $1.3 billion dollars in order to balance the budget. This year, they are looking for new ways to bring in revenue and casino gaming seems to be one option that has broad support.

In a statement released following the vote, Governor DeSantis said “I am grateful to the House for their hard work in passing this important legislation which will provide much needed relief for Florida’s taxpayers. I look forward to working with the Senate as we move closer to providing much needed relief for Florida families.”

It is now up to the Senate to take up the bill and pass it before it can be sent on to Governor DeSantis for his signature.
