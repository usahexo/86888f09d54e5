#  What is the genre of Fire & Steel?

Fire & Steel is a medieval-themed, action RPG. It was created by Justin March and released in February of 2017.

The game is set in the fictional world of Lanthir Lamath, which is inhabited by elves, dwarves, and humans. Players take on the role of an adventurer who must defeat the armies of the evil god Dormammu.

Fire & Steel borrows elements from several different genres, including action games, RPGs, and strategy games. The game is played from a top-down perspective, and players can choose between melee or ranged combat. There are also numerous quests to complete, items to find, and enemies to defeat.

#  What are the developers of Fire & Steel?

The developers of Fire & Steel are a small team of independent developers who have come together to work on this game out of their love for strategy games and the desire to create something new and unique. We all have a lot of experience in the industry, and we're all dedicated to making Fire & Steel the best game it can be.

# What is Fire & Steel?

Fire & Steel is a 4X turn-based strategy game set in a medieval fantasy world. You play as one of four races – humans, elves, dwarves, or orcs – competing for control of the land. You'll build up your armies, explore the world, trade with other factions, and battle for supremacy.

# What sets Fire & Steel apart from other strategy games?

There are a few things that make Fire & Steel stand out from other strategy games. First and foremost is the setting; most strategy games take place in either a historical setting or an abstract sci-fi setting, but Fire & Steel is set in a fantasy world that's completely different from anything else on the market. Second is the focus on troop customization; in most strategy games, each unit is pretty much identical to every other unit of the same type, but in Fire & Steel each unit has unique abilities and stats that make them distinct from their fellows. Finally, there's the multiplayer component; while most strategy games are designed for singleplayer only, Fire &Steel has both online and local multiplayer so you can battle your friends for control of the realm.

# When will Fire & Steel be released?

We're aiming for a release in late 2017/early 2018.
