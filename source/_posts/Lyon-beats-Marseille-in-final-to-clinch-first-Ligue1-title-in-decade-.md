LYON, France (AFP) — Lyon beat Marseille 2-1 on Saturday to clinch their first Ligue 1 title in a decade with three games to spare.

Memphis Depay and Nabil Fekir scored for Lyon either side of half-time as they completed an unbeaten season at home.

Florian Thauvin pulled one back for Marseille in the closing stages but it was not enough to deny Bruno Genesio’s side the championship.

Lyon’s last title came in 2008/09, when they finished four points clear of Marseille. But Rudi Garcia’s men have been the main challengers to Lyon over the past few years and they came closest to ending their hosts’ reign last season when they lost out by a point.

This time around, though, there was no stopping Genesio’s side, who were inspired by captain Nabil Fekir throughout the campaign.

#  Monaco dominates Ligue1, PSG finishes as runner-up 

For the third consecutive season, Monaco has won the Ligue1 championship, finishing ahead of Paris Saint-Germain by a margin of nine points. PSG was hoping to finally break Monaco’s stranglehold on the league, but were ultimately unsuccessful.

The two teams were neck and neck for much of the season, but Monaco pulled away in the final few months. They finished with 85 points, while PSG had 76.

Monaco had a number of standout performers over the course of the campaign. Chief among them was striker Radamel Falcao, who finished as the league’s top scorer with 26 goals. Other contributors included midfielder Bernardo Silva and winger Thomas Lemar.

PSG had its own stand out performer in striker Edinson Cavani, who scored 35 goals in all competitions. However, it wasn’t enough to help them win the title.

There were some disappointing performances from PSG as well. Notably, their defence let them down at times, conceding 49 goals in total - more than any other team in the top four. This ultimately proved to be their downfall.

Looking ahead, Monaco will be aiming to make it a fourth consecutive Ligue1 title, while PSG will be desperate to finally dethrone them.

#  Neymar leads Paris Saint-Germain to domestic treble in first season 

For Neymar, the 2017-18 season was a campaign to remember. He helped lead Paris Saint-Germain to a domestic treble in his first season with the club, scoring 28 goals and registering 16 assists in all competitions.

The Brazil international started the season in excellent form, scoring 10 goals in his first nine appearances for the club. This included a hat-trick against Celtic in the Champions League, as well as braces against Toulouse, Nice and Angers.

PSG would eventually go on to win their fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title, finishing 13 points clear of second-place Monaco. Neymar was directly involved in 31 goals during the league campaign, scoring 20 and providing 11 assists.

He was similarly impressive in the Coupe de France, netting five times as PSG lifted the trophy with a 5-0 win over Monaco in the final. Neymar also scored twice as PSG retained their Trophée des Champions title with a 3-0 victory over Lyon.

In total, Neymar scored 28 goals and registered 16 assists as PSG won four trophies in his first season with the club. This makes him one of only six players to have won four major trophies in their first season with a French club.

#  Historic relegation for Corsican side Ajaccio after 66 years in top flight 

Ajaccio, the capital of the French island of Corsica, were relegated from Ligue 1 after 66 years in France's top flight following a 1-0 home defeat by Troyes on Saturday.

The match was played in front of a largely empty Jean-Loup DASSAULT stadium as Corsican fans stayed away in protest at the club's uncertain future.

Ajaccio, who had been in the top flight since 1951/52, finished bottom of the table with just 25 points, four fewer than 17th-placed Lorient.

"There are no words to describe what I'm feeling," said Ajaccio captain Lionel Mathieu. "We're all devastated."

The relegation is a huge blow to the club, who are facing an uncertain future with debts estimated at around 10 million euros.

#  Monaco Vice: Teenage sensation Mbappé helps fire club to 2nd place

Kylian Mbappé, the 18-year-old sensation, is turning heads in the world of football. He has been scoring goals for fun since his breakthrough season at Monaco and has continued this form into this campaign.

The player’s meteoric rise has seen him become one of the most sought-after talents in world football, with teams such as Real Madrid and Barcelona vying for his signature. His performances have not gone unnoticed, with the French national team’s manager Didier Deschamps naming him in the squad for their World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg on 3 September.

Mbappé’s brace against Caen on Saturday helped Monaco secure a 2–1 victory and move up to second place in Ligue 1, just two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. In total, he has scored 11 goals in all competitions this season, including six in Ligue 1.

It was not always plain sailing for the youngster, who was born in Bondy, a suburb of Paris. He started his career at AS Bondy before being scouted by Monaco at the age of just 14. He initially played for their reserve team before making his first-team debut in December 2015.

Mbappé wasted no time in making an impact at Monaco, scoring on his debut in a 3–1 victory over Troyes. The rest, as they say, is history. In his breakout season last year, he scored 15 goals and registered eight assists as Monaco won the Ligue 1 title.

What makes Mbappé so special? The player possesses electric pace and dribbling ability, as well as an eye for goal. These qualities have seen him likened to some of the greatest players to have ever played the game, such as Lionel Messi and Neymar Jr.

Monaco are understandably reluctant to sell their prized asset but it is inevitable that he will move on to bigger things in the near future. The player himself has spoken of his admiration for both Real Madrid and Barcelona, although he insists he is happy at Monaco for now.

Whatever happens in the future, Mbappé is destined for great things and looks set to take world football by storm.
