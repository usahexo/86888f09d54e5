are the 5 best things about the real time news media","date":"2022-09-02T08:49:14.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the 5 best things about the real-time news media?\n\nThere are many good things about the real-time news media, but here are five of the best:\n\n1. It's instantaneous\n\nThe best thing about real-time news media is that it's instantaneous. You no longer have to wait for the morning paper or the evening news to find out what's going on in the world. With real-time news media, you can find out as soon as it happens.\n\n2. It's comprehensive\n\nAnother great thing about real-time news media is that it's comprehensive. You can get news from all around the world, from all different sources, all in one place. This makes it a great resource for keeping up with current events.\n\n3. It's up-to-date\n\nReal-time news media is also up-to-date. News sources are constantly updating their information, so you can be sure that you're getting the latest news. This is especially important for those who need to stay informed about current events.\n\n4. It's convenient\n\nReal-time news media is also very convenient. You can access it from anywhere in the world, and you can get it on any device you want. This means that you can get your news whenever and wherever you want it.\n\n5. It's reliable\n\nFinally, real-time news media is reliable. Sources are reputable and accurate, so you can be sure that the information you're getting is correct. This is important for those who need to be sure they're getting the right information.\"\n\n#  What impact has the real-time news media had on society?\n\nThe 24-hour news cycle has had a profound impact on society, particularly in the way that we consume and process information. The relentless barrage of breaking news can be overwhelming and often leads to a sense of information overload. It can be difficult to sift through the noise and identify what is actually important.\n\nThe real-time news media has also had a negative impact on our cognitive abilities. A study by the University of Texas found that the constant stream of updates caused people to become overwhelmed and stressed out. They also found that people were more likely to make poor decisions when they were feeling stressed.\n\nThe real-time news media has also had a negative impact on our social interactions. A study by the University of Utah found that people were more likely to share fake news stories if they were consuming them in real-time. This is because people are more likely to believe information if it is presented to them quickly and without any filter.\n\nOverall, I think it is safe to say that the real-time news media has had a negative impact on society. It has caused us to become overwhelmed and stressed out, and it has made us more susceptible to fake news stories.\n\n#  What are the benefits of the real-time news media?\n\nWhen most people think about the news, they think about stories that are days, weeks, or even months old. However, with the advent of real-time news media, people can now get information as it happens. This has a number of benefits for both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nIndividuals who follow real-time news media can gain a better understanding of what is happening in the world around them. They can also form their own opinions on events as they happen, rather than having to wait for someone else to tell them what to think. Additionally, by following several different real-time news sources, individuals can get a more well-rounded view of current events.\n\nSimilarly, society as a whole benefits from real-time news media. For example, when something major happens (e.g. a natural disaster or terrorist attack), being able to get information as it happens allows officials and relief workers to respond more quickly and effectively. Additionally, real-time news media can help keep the public informed about important issues that may not otherwise be covered by traditional media outlets.\n\n#  How has the real-time news media changed the way people access information?\n\nIn the past, people would primarily access information through newspapers and other physical forms of media. This began to change with the advent of radio and television, which allowed for people to receive news in a more timely manner. However, with the rise of the internet, people are now able to access information in real-time, as it is happening. This has had a significant impact on both how people access information and how they process it.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of real-time news media is that it allows people to instantaneously participate in conversations about current events. For example, if there is a major news story unfolding, people can use social media platforms like Twitter to share their thoughts and concerns about it. This also allows for journalists and news organizations to get a sense of public opinion about current events much more quickly than ever before. Additionally, real-time news media has made it easier for people to stay informed about breaking news stories. In many cases, people no longer need to rely on traditional forms of media like television or radio to hear about major news events. Instead, they can simply check their favourite social media platforms or websites to get up-to-date information.\n\nOverall, real-time news media has had a significant impact on how people access and process information. It has allowed for people to have more immediate conversations about current events, and it has made it easier for them to stay informed about breaking news stories.\n\n#  What are some criticisms of the real-time news media?\n\nOne common criticism of the real-time news media is that it is often biased. Another critique is that it can be sensationalist, leading to \"news\" that is not actually news. Additionally, some argue that the real-time news media can be shallow, focusing on the latest developments without providing adequate context or analysis. Finally, there is the concern that the real-time news media can be harmful to democracy by spreading misinformation and undermining trust in institutions.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-5-best-things-about-the-real-time-news-media.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the 5 best things about the real time news media\ndate: 2022-09-02 16:49:14\ncategories:\n- News Media\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the 5 best things about the real-time news media?\n\nThere are many good things about the real-time news media, but here are five of the best:\n\n1.

For example, when something major happens (e.g. a natural disaster or terrorist attack), being able to get information as it happens allows officials and relief workers to respond more quickly and effectively. Additionally, real-time news media can help keep the public informed about important issues that may not otherwise be covered by traditional media outlets.\n\n#  How has the real-time news media changed the way people access information?\n\nIn the past, people would primarily access information through newspapers and other physical forms of media. This began to change with the advent of radio and television, which allowed for people to receive news in a more timely manner. However, with the rise of the internet, people are now able to access information in real-time, as it is happening. This has had a significant impact on both how people access information and how they process it.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of real-time news media is that it allows people to instantaneously participate in conversations about current events. For example, if there is a major news story unfolding, people can use social media platforms like Twitter to share their thoughts and concerns about it. This also allows for journalists and news organizations to get a sense of public opinion about current events much more quickly than ever before. Additionally, real-time news media has made it easier for people to stay informed about breaking news stories. In many cases, people no longer need to rely on traditional forms of media like television or radio to hear about major news events. Instead, they can simply check their favourite social media platforms or websites to get up-to-date information.\n\nOverall, real-time news media has had a significant impact on how people access and process information. It has allowed for people to have more immediate conversations about current events, and it has made it easier for them to stay informed about breaking news stories.\n\n#  What are some criticisms of the real-time news media?\n\nOne common criticism of the real-time news media is that it is often biased. Another critique is that it can be sensationalist, leading to \"news\" that is not actually news. Additionally, some argue that the real-time news media can be shallow, focusing on the latest developments without providing adequate context or analysis. Finally, there is the concern that the real-time news media can be harmful to democracy by spreading misinformation and undermining trust in institutions.","slug":"What-are-the-5-best-things-about-the-real-time-news-media","published":1,"updated":"2022-09-02T08:49:14.286Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl7k8ipf400010wv5hp67d20v","content":"<h1 id=\"What-are-the-5-best-things-about-the-real-time-news-media\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-5-best-things-about-the-real-time-news-media\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the 5 best things about the real-time news media?\"></a>What are the 5 best things about the real-time news media?</h1><p>There are many good things about the real-time news media, but here are five of the best:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s instantaneous</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The best thing about real-time news media is that it’s instantaneous.

Increasingly, it seems that those in positions of power are able to control the narrative by definition: what is seen as news, what is considered to be true, and what is ultimately allowed to be discussed.\n\nIt is therefore more critical than ever that we as individuals take the time to educate ourselves about the difference between news and truth. By understanding the dangers of blindly trusting in whatever is presented to us as “news”, we can begin to see through the manipulation and propaganda that often passes for information in our society today.\n\nSo, what is the difference between news and truth? The simplest way to think about it is that news is something that someone has decided to call news. It doesn’t necessarily have to be true, it just has to be reported or presented as such. Truth, on the other hand, is based in reality – it exists whether or not anyone reports it.\n\nOne way to think about it is by considering events that have made headlines in recent years. For example, consider how many different versions of the story there were surrounding the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Depending on which outlet you were watching or reading, you may have had completely different ideas about what happened – even though all of those stories were based on the same underlying facts.\n\nThis kind of inaccuracy and bias is unfortunately all too common in mainstream media outlets. In order to control the narrative, those in power often manipulate information so that it conforms with their own agenda. This can include everything from simply omitting certain details that don’t support their story, to outright lying about events altogether.\n\nAt its worst, this can lead to things like mass hysteria and witch hunts – as we saw with the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s. By controlling what people consider to be “truth”, those in power are able to advance their own interests and agendas without fear of opposition.\n\nSo how do we protect ourselves from these kinds of manipulations? The most important thing is to always remember that truth exists independent of any individual or organization. No matter who is presenting information as “news”, we should always take a moment to check and verify the sources before deciding whether or not to believe it.\n\nWe also need to be thoughtful about where we get our information from. Instead of relying solely on mainstream media outlets, which are notorious for bending the truth in order to serve their own interests, try looking for alternative sources of information instead. There are now countless blogs, podcasts and websites out there that offer alternative perspectives on current events – many of which are far more trustworthy than mainstream media.\n\n#  How can the average person distinguish between news and truth?\n\nEveryone has a different answer to this question, but here are five tips that can help you distinguish between news and truth.\n\n1. Check the source.\n\nOne of the best ways to determine if a news article is true or not is to check the source. Many times, you can do a quick Google search of the website or author to see if they are reputable. If the website looks like it was made in Microsoft Word, or if the author has no other articles published on reputable sites, it's probably not worth your time.\n\n2. Look for biases.\n\nMany popular news sources have biases, which means that they often report news in a certain way to reflect their beliefs. For example, FOX News is known for being conservative, while MSNBC is known for being liberal. If you're not sure about a news source's bias, you can always do a quick Google search of \"source bias.\" This should give you some idea about how credible the source is likely to be.\n\n3. Check the date.\n\nOne telltale sign that an article might be fake is if it's very old but is being circulated as if it's new news. Oftentimes, fake articles will reuse images and quotes from older articles in an attempt to make them seem more credible. So before you share an article on social media, be sure to check the date to make sure it's recent.\n\n4. Look for evidence.\n\nWhen reading a news article, ask yourself whether or not the information seems to be backed up by evidence. For example, does the article provide links to studies or government reports? Or does it simply state opinions as facts? If the article doesn't provide any evidence, be wary; it's likely that the information isn't true.\n\n5. Use common sense.\n\nIn many cases, common sense can be your best tool for distinguishing between news and truth. Does the story sound too good (or too bad) to be true? Are there any obvious spelling mistakes or grammatical errors? Is the article written in a style that sounds like propaganda? If so, it's probably best not to believe it.\n\n#  Why do newspapers and other forms of traditional media often report news that is not the truth?\n\nNewspapers have a long history of being used as a propaganda tool by those in power. In the early days of America, newspapers were essentially the only way for people to get news. This made them a powerful tool for those in power who could use them to control the population.\n\nToday, things are a little different. Television and the internet have created new ways for people to get their news. This has led to a decline in the popularity of newspapers. As a result, newspapers are desperate to stay relevant and they often report news that is not the truth in order to create headlines that will attract attention.\n\n#  What are some of the negative consequences of news that is not the truth?\n\nWhen people are bombarded with news that is not the truth, it can have a number of negative consequences. First, it can cause people to mistrust the news media. This can lead to people not getting accurate information about important issues. Additionally, when people are exposed to fake news, it can cause them to doubt the validity of other information they receive, including information from trusted sources. This can lead to distorted views on important topics and can even impact people's voting decisions. Finally, fake news can be used to sow division and hatred among people, which can ultimately lead to conflict and violence.\n\n#  What can be done to ensure that news is presented accurately and fairly?\n\nThere are many different ways that people get their news, and it is important that news is presented accurately and fairly to ensure that the public has the best information possible. Most people get their news from television, newspapers, or the internet. Each of these sources has its own way of reporting the news, and there are several things that can be done to make sure that the news is presented accurately and fairly.\n\nFor television news, one of the most important things is to have a good cross-check system. This means having more than one person verify the accuracy of a story before it is aired. It is also important to have a good fact checker who can verify the accuracy of the information in a story. Television news organizations should also have a policy for correcting errors. If an error is made, the organization should correct it as quickly as possible and issue an apology to anyone who may have been affected by the mistake.\n\nNewspapers also need to be accurate and fair in their reporting. One way to do this is to make sure that all sides of a story are represented. Another way to ensure accuracy is through fact checking. Newspaper organizations should also have a policy for correcting mistakes. If an error is made, it should be corrected as quickly as possible and an apology issued to anyone who may have been affected by the mistake.\n\nThe internet has become an important source of news for many people, and it is important that news organizations presenting online stories adhere to the same standards as those organizations presenting stories on television and in newspapers. One way to ensure accuracy and fairness online is through using hyperlinks. This allows readers to access additional information about a story so they can decide for themselves if they agree with what has been reported. Online newspapers should also have a policy for correcting mistakes.\n\nMaking sure that news is presented accurately and fairly is vital in order for the public to make informed decisions about the world around them","source":"_posts/What-is-the-difference-between-news-and-truth.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the difference between news and truth\ndate: 2022-09-21 19:15:04\ncategories:\n- News Media\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the difference between news and truth?\n\nIn an age where the lines between fact and fiction have become increasingly blurred, the question of what constitutes “news” has taken on a new level of importance.

By understanding the dangers of blindly trusting in whatever is presented to us as “news”, we can begin to see through the manipulation and propaganda that often passes for information in our society today.</p>\n<p>So, what is the difference between news and truth? The simplest way to think about it is that news is something that someone has decided to call news. It doesn’t necessarily have to be true, it just has to be reported or presented as such. Truth, on the other hand, is based in reality – it exists whether or not anyone reports it.</p>\n<p>One way to think about it is by considering events that have made headlines in recent years. For example, consider how many different versions of the story there were surrounding the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Depending on which outlet you were watching or reading, you may have had completely different ideas about what happened – even though all of those stories were based on the same underlying facts.</p>\n<p>This kind of inaccuracy and bias is unfortunately all too common in mainstream media outlets. In order to control the narrative, those in power often manipulate information so that it conforms with their own agenda. This can include everything from simply omitting certain details that don’t support their story, to outright lying about events altogether.</p>\n<p>At its worst, this can lead to things like mass hysteria and witch hunts – as we saw with the McCarthy hearings in the 1950s. By controlling what people consider to be “truth”, those in power are able to advance their own interests and agendas without fear of opposition.</p>\n<p>So how do we protect ourselves from these kinds of manipulations? The most important thing is to always remember that truth exists independent of any individual or organization. No matter who is presenting information as “news”, we should always take a moment to check and verify the sources before deciding whether or not to believe it.</p>\n<p>We also need to be thoughtful about where we get our information from. Instead of relying solely on mainstream media outlets, which are notorious for bending the truth in order to serve their own interests, try looking for alternative sources of information instead. There are now countless blogs, podcasts and websites out there that offer alternative perspectives on current events – many of which are far more trustworthy than mainstream media.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-can-the-average-person-distinguish-between-news-and-truth\"><a href=\"#How-can-the-average-person-distinguish-between-news-and-truth\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How can the average person distinguish between news and truth?\"></a>How can the average person distinguish between news and truth?</h1><p>Everyone has a different answer to this question, but here are five tips that can help you distinguish between news and truth.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the source.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the best ways to determine if a news article is true or not is to check the source. Many times, you can do a quick Google search of the website or author to see if they are reputable. If the website looks like it was made in Microsoft Word, or if the author has no other articles published on reputable sites, it’s probably not worth your time.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Look for biases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Many popular news sources have biases, which means that they often report news in a certain way to reflect their beliefs. For example, FOX News is known for being conservative, while MSNBC is known for being liberal. If you’re not sure about a news source’s bias, you can always do a quick Google search of “source bias.” This should give you some idea about how credible the source is likely to be.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Check the date.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One telltale sign that an article might be fake is if it’s very old but is being circulated as if it’s new news. Oftentimes, fake articles will reuse images and quotes from older articles in an attempt to make them seem more credible. So before you share an article on social media, be sure to check the date to make sure it’s recent.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Look for evidence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When reading a news article, ask yourself whether or not the information seems to be backed up by evidence. For example, does the article provide links to studies or government reports? Or does it simply state opinions as facts? If the article doesn’t provide any evidence, be wary; it’s likely that the information isn’t true.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Use common sense.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In many cases, common sense can be your best tool for distinguishing between news and truth. Does the story sound too good (or too bad) to be true? Are there any obvious spelling mistakes or grammatical errors? Is the article written in a style that sounds like propaganda?

This will give you the best odds of winning against the house.\n\n# What is basic strategy?\n\nBasic strategy is a chart that tells you the best way to play each hand in blackjack, depending on the cards that are shown. It takes into account the dealer's upcard, as well as your own cards.\n\n# How can I use basic strategy?\n\nUsing basic strategy is simple. Just look up the situation you are in on the chart, and follow the instructions. For instance, if you are playing against a dealer who has an ace up, and you have a two, three or four, you would hit. If you have a five or six, you would stand.\n\n# Why should I use basic strategy?\n\nBasic strategy gives you the best chance of winning against the house. It's based on mathematical probabilities, so it's always the best option to use when playing blackjack.\n\n#  What are the house rules for blackjack at a live casino?\n\nWhen playing blackjack at a live casino, there are a few house rules to be aware of. One such rule is that the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. If the dealer has an ace as their upcard, they can choose to hit or stand (up to the player). This is different from online blackjack, where the dealer must hit on all hands regardless of their upcard.\n\nAnother rule to be aware of when playing blackjack at a live casino is whether or not doubling down and splitting are allowed. Some casinos allow players to double down on any two cards, while others only allow doubling down on 10 and 11. As for splitting, some casinos will allow players to split any two cards, while others restrict splitting to pairs of Aces, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 10s.\n\nPlayers should also be aware of the casino’s blackjack rules regarding surrender. Some casinos will let players surrender after their first two cards if they think they have no chance of winning, while others don’t offer this option at all.\n\nFinally, be sure to ask about the casino’s rules regarding insurance. In most cases, insurance is not a good bet and should be avoided, but it’s important to know what the rules are at each casino before deciding whether or not to take it.\n\n#  What is the expected return of playing blackjack at a live casino?\n\nWhen playing blackjack at a live casino, the expected return is 99.5%. This means that over time, the average player can expect to win nearly $0.99 for every $100 they bet. While this may not seem like a lot, it can add up over time!\n\n#  Is blackjack cheating grounds for casino expulsion?\n\nCasinos take cheating seriously. Players caught cheating can face criminal charges, fines, and even expulsion from the casino. So, is blackjack cheating considered a serious offense?\n\nBlackjack is a game of skill and chance. The object of the game is to draw cards that total 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Players can win by either getting blackjack (an ace and a 10-value card) or by beating the dealer’s card total.\n\nSince blackjack relies on both chance and skill, some people attempt to cheat their way to victory. This can involve anything from marking cards to sleight of hand tricks. Casinos have developed ways to detect cheating, so perpetrators usually stand a very good chance of getting caught.\n\nWhen it comes to cheating in blackjack, there are three main offenses: counting cards, fake betting, and smuggling chips.\n\nCounting cards is probably the most well-known form of blackjack cheating. It involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can make better choices about when to bet and when to hold back. Casinos use surveillance technologies like deck-cameras and RFID readers to detect card counters, so it’s not easy to get away with this type of cheating.\n\nFake betting is exactly what it sounds like – making fake bets in order to fool the dealer into thinking you have a stronger hand than you actually do. This type of cheating is usually done by placing high bets at strategic moments in order to influence the dealer’s decision-making process. It’s not as common as counting cards or smuggling chips, but it can be just as effective if executed correctly.\n\nSmuggling chips is probably the least sophisticated form of blackjack cheating, but it can be quite profitable if done correctly. Smugglers try to disguise extra chips as legitimate ones in order to place bigger bets without arousing suspicion. Casino security teams are usually pretty adept at detecting illegitimate chips, so this type of cheating is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off.\n\nSo, is blackjack cheating grounds for casino expulsion?

This will give you the best odds of winning against the house.\n\n# What is basic strategy?\n\nBasic strategy is a chart that tells you the best way to play each hand in blackjack, depending on the cards that are shown. It takes into account the dealer's upcard, as well as your own cards.\n\n# How can I use basic strategy?\n\nUsing basic strategy is simple. Just look up the situation you are in on the chart, and follow the instructions. For instance, if you are playing against a dealer who has an ace up, and you have a two, three or four, you would hit. If you have a five or six, you would stand.\n\n# Why should I use basic strategy?\n\nBasic strategy gives you the best chance of winning against the house. It's based on mathematical probabilities, so it's always the best option to use when playing blackjack.\n\n#  What are the house rules for blackjack at a live casino?\n\nWhen playing blackjack at a live casino, there are a few house rules to be aware of. One such rule is that the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. If the dealer has an ace as their upcard, they can choose to hit or stand (up to the player). This is different from online blackjack, where the dealer must hit on all hands regardless of their upcard.\n\nAnother rule to be aware of when playing blackjack at a live casino is whether or not doubling down and splitting are allowed. Some casinos allow players to double down on any two cards, while others only allow doubling down on 10 and 11. As for splitting, some casinos will allow players to split any two cards, while others restrict splitting to pairs of Aces, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s and 10s.\n\nPlayers should also be aware of the casino’s blackjack rules regarding surrender. Some casinos will let players surrender after their first two cards if they think they have no chance of winning, while others don’t offer this option at all.\n\nFinally, be sure to ask about the casino’s rules regarding insurance. In most cases, insurance is not a good bet and should be avoided, but it’s important to know what the rules are at each casino before deciding whether or not to take it.\n\n#  What is the expected return of playing blackjack at a live casino?\n\nWhen playing blackjack at a live casino, the expected return is 99.5%. This means that over time, the average player can expect to win nearly $0.99 for every $100 they bet. While this may not seem like a lot, it can add up over time!\n\n#  Is blackjack cheating grounds for casino expulsion?\n\nCasinos take cheating seriously. Players caught cheating can face criminal charges, fines, and even expulsion from the casino. So, is blackjack cheating considered a serious offense?\n\nBlackjack is a game of skill and chance. The object of the game is to draw cards that total 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Players can win by either getting blackjack (an ace and a 10-value card) or by beating the dealer’s card total.\n\nSince blackjack relies on both chance and skill, some people attempt to cheat their way to victory. This can involve anything from marking cards to sleight of hand tricks. Casinos have developed ways to detect cheating, so perpetrators usually stand a very good chance of getting caught.\n\nWhen it comes to cheating in blackjack, there are three main offenses: counting cards, fake betting, and smuggling chips.\n\nCounting cards is probably the most well-known form of blackjack cheating. It involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can make better choices about when to bet and when to hold back. Casinos use surveillance technologies like deck-cameras and RFID readers to detect card counters, so it’s not easy to get away with this type of cheating.\n\nFake betting is exactly what it sounds like – making fake bets in order to fool the dealer into thinking you have a stronger hand than you actually do. This type of cheating is usually done by placing high bets at strategic moments in order to influence the dealer’s decision-making process. It’s not as common as counting cards or smuggling chips, but it can be just as effective if executed correctly.\n\nSmuggling chips is probably the least sophisticated form of blackjack cheating, but it can be quite profitable if done correctly. Smugglers try to disguise extra chips as legitimate ones in order to place bigger bets without arousing suspicion. Casino security teams are usually pretty adept at detecting illegitimate chips, so this type of cheating is becoming increasingly difficult to pull off.\n\nSo, is blackjack cheating grounds for casino expulsion? In short, yes – casinos take any form of cheating extremely seriously and will usually expel any player caught doing it. However, with the advent of sophisticated security technologies like deck-cameras and RFID readers, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for cheaters to get away with their shenanigans. If you’re looking to beat the casino at its own game, your best bet is simply to hone your skills and play fair!\n\n#  Are there any blackjack tips that can help players improve their chances of winning?\n\nThere are many blackjack tips that players can use to improve their chances of winning. One of the most important is to learn the basic strategy for the game. This involves studying the different hands and learning what move is best to make in each situation. Players can also increase their chances of winning by using a blackjack strategy chart as a reference.\n\nAnother important tip is to always play with money that you can afford to lose.
