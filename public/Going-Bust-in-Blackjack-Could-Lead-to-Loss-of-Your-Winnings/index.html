When you go bust, you lose your entire bet - even if the dealer also goes bust.</p>
<p>Most casino games have a house edge - the advantage that the casino has over the player. In blackjack, this edge is about 1%. This means that for every $100 you wager, the casino expects to keep about $1 as profit.</p>
<p>However, when you go bust, your loss is 100% of your bet. So if you bet $100 and go bust, you lose $100. If the dealer also goes bust, you still lose your $100 bet.</p>
<p>In order to avoid going bust, try to stay below 21 points total. If you have 16 or lower, you should stand (unless the dealer has a 6 or lower). If you have 17 or higher, you should hit (unless the dealer has an Ace).</p>
<p>It’s always important to remember that in blackjack, there is risk involved in every decision. Even if you follow perfect strategy, there’s still a chance that you’ll lose money. However, understanding the risk of going bust can help keep your losses to a minimum.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-Going-Bust-Mean-in-Blackjack"><a href="#What-Does-Going-Bust-Mean-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What Does Going Bust Mean in Blackjack?"></a>What Does Going Bust Mean in Blackjack?</h1><p>When you go bust in blackjack, it means that your total value of cards is over 21 and you automatically lose the hand. This can happen in a few ways - for example, if you have two cards worth 10 points each and then draw another card worth 10 points, your total would be 30 and you would go bust. </p>
<p>If you are playing with more than one deck of cards, the dealer’s bust is also an option - for example, if the dealer has two cards worth 10 points each and then draws an ace, their total would be 21 and they would go bust. </p>
<p>In either case, when you or the dealer goes bust, the hand is automatically over and the other player wins.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-21-What-Happens-if-You-Go-Bust"><a href="#Blackjack-21-What-Happens-if-You-Go-Bust" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack 21: What Happens if You Go Bust?"></a>Blackjack 21: What Happens if You Go Bust?</h1><p>If you go over 21 in blackjack, you “bust.” This means that you have lost your bet, even if the dealer also goes over 21.</p>
<p>In some cases, busting can result in a very large loss. For example, if you have a $10 bet and you go over 21, you will lose $10 plus the amount of your bet. If you have a $100 bet and you bust, you will lose $100 plus the amount of your bet.</p>
<p>Some casinos allow players to restart their bets after they bust. Others require players to forfeit their entire bets when they bust.</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-Going-Bust-Affect-the-House-Edge-in-Blackjack"><a href="#How-Does-Going-Bust-Affect-the-House-Edge-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="How Does Going Bust Affect the House Edge in Blackjack?"></a>How Does Going Bust Affect the House Edge in Blackjack?</h1><p>Slot machines are the bread and butter of casinos, but blackjack is a close second. In fact, blackjack is considered the casino game that offers the best chance of winning for players. This is because the house edge in blackjack can be as low as 0.5%, while the house edge in slot machines can be as high as 10%.</p>
<p>But what happens to the house edge when a player goes bust?</p>
<p>In general, when a player goes bust in blackjack, the house edge increases by about 1%. So, if the house edge was previously at 0.5%, it will now be at 1.5%. This increase in the house edge means that players are less likely to win when they play blackjack, which is why it’s important to know when to quit if you’re on a losing streak.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that some casinos offer worse rules for players who go bust than for those who don’t. For example, some casinos may increase the house edge from 1% to 2% for players who go bust. So, it’s important to do your research before playing blackjack at a particular casino.</p>
<p>Overall, going bust doesn’t have a huge impact on the house edge in blackjack. However, it’s still important to be aware of these changes so you can make informed decisions about when to stop playing.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-the-Risks-of-Going-Bust-in-Blackjack"><a href="#What-Are-the-Risks-of-Going-Bust-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Risks of Going Bust in Blackjack?"></a>What Are the Risks of Going Bust in Blackjack?</h1><p>There are a few risks that come with going bust in blackjack. The first and most obvious one is that you can lose the game. If you go over 21, then the dealer automatically wins, no matter what they have. This can be pretty devastating if you’re close to winning or if you were only a few chips away from breaking even.</p>
<p>Another risk of going bust is that it can lead to bad habits. When you’re desperate to make up for your losses, you might start making reckless plays or risking too much money on each hand. This can quickly lead to bigger losses and more frustration. It’s important to remember that blackjack is a game of patience and strategy - if you start playing recklessly, you’re likely to end up losing more than you gain.</p>
<p>Finally, going bust can also cause psychological distress. Losing money is always tough, but when it happens in a high-stakes game like blackjack, it can be especially demoralizing. If you find yourself consistently going bust, it might be time to take a break from the game or reconsider your betting strategy.</p>
