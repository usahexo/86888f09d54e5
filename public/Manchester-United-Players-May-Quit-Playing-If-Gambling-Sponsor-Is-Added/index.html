<p>The potential addition of a gambling sponsor to the club’s jerseys has caused some players to consider their future with the club, as they are not comfortable with the idea of promoting gambling.</p>
<p>Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba are among the players who have expressed their concerns about the potential sponsorship deal.</p>
<p>Fellaini, in particular, said that he would have to think about his future at the club if a gambling company became its main sponsor.</p>
<p>“I don’t like that. For me, I don’t like it. I don’t know if other players feel the same but for me I don’t want to promote that kind of thing, it’s not something that interests me,” he said.</p>
<p>Pogba also commented on the sponsorship deal, saying that he is not “comfortable with it.”</p>
<p>Manager Jose Mourinho has said that he will do what is best for the team and will respect any decision that the players make in regards to the sponsorship deal.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Teams-Could-Lose-Out-On-Playoff-Money-If-Sports-Gambling-Goes-Legal"><a href="#MLB-Teams-Could-Lose-Out-On-Playoff-Money-If-Sports-Gambling-Goes-Legal" class="headerlink" title="MLB Teams Could Lose Out On Playoff Money If Sports Gambling Goes Legal"></a>MLB Teams Could Lose Out On Playoff Money If Sports Gambling Goes Legal</h1><p>Baseball’s top teams could lose out on millions of dollars if sports gambling goes legal. The potential issue lies in baseball’s current dual structure in which its national television contracts are shared by the teams and MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), the company that operates its digital properties.</p>
<p>The eight teams in this year’s World Series – the Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays – will split about $84 million just for appearing in the Fall Classic. If a state with legal sports betting went all-in on baseball, it would be more attractive to bet on games outcome rather than individual players performance. This could result in a decrease in viewership across the entire sport, which would impact the bottom line of not just the teams involved in the World Series, but also every other team in MLB.</p>
<p>According to Darren Rovell of The Action Network, about $4 billion is bet on baseball annually in the United States. That number would likely increase if sports gambling were made legal on a state-by-state basis. Just last week, Delaware became the latest state to offer full-blown sports gambling following a Supreme Court decision earlier this year that allowed states to decide their own gambling laws.</p>
<p>While it is still unclear how much money individual states will generate from sports gambling, it is safe to assume that MLB would see a smaller slice of the pie should it go legal. For example, Nevada currently accounts for about $500 million of the $5 billion that is legally wagered on sports each year. If other states followed suit and legalized sports betting, it would be difficult for MLBAM to continue generating its current level of revenue given that it would now have to compete with casinos and racetracks for gambling dollars.</p>
<p>MLB has been preparing for this day for some time and has already taken steps to protect its interests. For example, agreements between teams and MLBAM give the league control over who can offer wagering on games involving those teams. In addition, any data or information used for wagering must first be approved by MLBAM. While these measures may provide some short-term relief if sports gambling does go legal, they likely won’t be enough to offset any long-term declines in viewership or revenue generated from bets placed on baseball games.</p>

<p>The NBA has long been against gambling on its games, and its owners have a vested interest in protecting the integrity of their sport. If gambling is legalized, it could open the door for fans to bet on games, which could impact the outcome of contests and thus undermine the league’s product.</p>
<p>Moreover, if sports gambling is legalized, it’s likely that casinos and other betting establishments will offer lucrative odds on NBA games. That could lure some fans away from placing bets with the league’s official partners, causing those companies to lose money.</p>
<p>All of this means that NBA owners could stand to lose millions of dollars if sports gambling is legalized. They will be keeping a close eye on the Supreme Court as it mulls over the case, and they will be hoping for a ruling that keeps gambling blacked out in most states.</p>

There are state laws, federal laws, and international laws to consider. And now there is the question of whether or not NASCAR and IndyCar racing should be legalized in the world of sports gambling.</p>
<p>On one hand, it could be argued that NASCAR and IndyCar racing are already popular enough that they don’t need the extra boost from legalized sports gambling. After all, these races have been around for decades and have loyal fans all over the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some people might argue that legalizing sports gambling could help to attract even more fans to these races. And if more people are watching these races, that could lead to even more sponsorships and revenue for NASCAR and IndyCar racing.</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to this debate. It will ultimately come down to what each individual person thinks is best for NASCAR and IndyCar racing. But it will be interesting to see how this debate plays out in the years ahead.</p>

<li><p>College football programs throughout the country could lose sponsorship deals if sports gambling is legalized.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many of these deals are worth millions of dollars, and the teams count on the revenue to help fund their programs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The NFL and NBA have already voiced their opposition to legalizing sports gambling, and now it looks like NCAA programs could be next in line to suffer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sponsors are not interested in being associated with a sport that is based on gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This could end up being a major issue for many colleges, especially those that rely on sponsorships to help finance their athletic programs.</p>
</li>
