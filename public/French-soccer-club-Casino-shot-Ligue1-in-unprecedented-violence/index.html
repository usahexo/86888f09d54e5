<p>The fight began when Casino midfielder Benoit Pedretti was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle late in the game. As he walked off the field, Pedretti began exchanging insults with several Casino players and fans. </p>
<p>Things quickly escalated, and casino forward David Heurtel delivered a flying kick to Pedretti’s head, sparking a bench-clearing brawl. The fight continued in the locker room, where Casino goalkeeper Jerome Alonzo was beaten so severely that he had to be hospitalized. </p>
<p>Casino president Jean-Pierre Ponsot has vowed that the club will take “severe measures” against the perpetrators of the violence. “This is an intolerable act that does not reflect the values of our club,” he said. </p>
<p>French soccer authorities have also condemned the violence, with Ligue1 commissioner Frédéric Thiriez calling it “a black day for French soccer.” He added that clubs will be held accountable for the actions of their fans and players. </p>
<p>Casino is already facing sanctions from UEFA after fans threw flares onto the field during a Champions League match earlier this year. Those sanctions could be increased after Sunday’s incident. </p>
<p>While it is unclear what specific measures Ponsot plans to take, it is likely that Casino will be fined and&#x2F;or docked points for its role in the melee.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-shot-Ligue1-amid-fear-and-chaos"><a href="#Casino-shot-Ligue1-amid-fear-and-chaos" class="headerlink" title="Casino shot Ligue1 amid fear and chaos"></a>Casino shot Ligue1 amid fear and chaos</h1><p>Casino shot Ligue1 amid fear and chaos</p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, Casino has announced it is withdrawing from Ligue1, the French top-flight football league. The move comes amid fears over match-fixing and chaotic management within the league.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Wednesday, Casino said it had “lost all confidence in the governance of the Ligue1” and that it could no longer “support misconduct by clubs and officials.”</p>
<p>The withdrawal is a major blow to Ligue1, which has been hit by a series of scandals in recent years. In May, French prosecutors charged 19 people with corruption following an investigation into match-fixing. The charges included ****** by several prominent clubs, including Marseille and Monaco.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, French media reported that Ligue1 was struggling financially, with several clubs facing bankruptcy. Casino’s withdrawal is likely to add to the crisis.</p>
<p>In its statement, Casino warned that other sponsors could also pull out of the league if action was not taken to address the issues in Ligue1. It called for “a new start for Ligue 1 with stronger governance and greater transparency.”</p>
<p>Casino’s decision comes after fellow sponsor Carrefour pulled out of Ligue1 last month.</p>
<h1 id="Club-officials-silent-after-Casino-shot-Ligue1"><a href="#Club-officials-silent-after-Casino-shot-Ligue1" class="headerlink" title="Club officials silent after Casino shot Ligue1"></a>Club officials silent after Casino shot Ligue1</h1><p>Casino officials are keeping silent after shots were fired outside the club on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The incident took place as first-division Casino were hosting second-division Ligue1 in a midweek cup match. Gunshots could be heard ringing out around the stadium in the final minutes of the game, which Ligue1 went on to win 3-2.</p>
<p>There have been no reports of any injuries and no arrests have been made, but Casino officials have refused to comment on the incident. It is not yet clear whether or not the gunshots were fired deliberately or if they were accidental.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that shots have been fired near a French football stadium. In November last year, four people were injured after gunmen opened fire in the car park of a amateur game in Marmande, southwestern France.</p>
<p>And in September 2015, a 14-year-old boy was killed after a gunman opened fire at a youth football game in Joue-les-Tours, central France.</p>

Casino shot Ligue1 in senseless act of violence"></a>How could this happen? Casino shot Ligue1 in senseless act of violence</h1><p>In a senseless act of violence, a casino Employee shot French football league Ligue1 in the head. The victim is currently in critical condition and is not expected to survive.</p>
<p>Authorities are investigating the motive for the attack, but have so far been unable to determine a reason for the shooting. The casino employee has been arrested and is currently in police custody.</p>
<p>Ligue1 is one of the most popular football leagues in the world, with teams from countries all over Europe competing. The league has not yet released a statement commenting on the shooting.</p>
<p>This tragic event will no doubt leave fans of Ligue1 heartbroken and searching for answers. How could someone so senselessly shoot one of the world’s most beloved football leagues? We can only hope that Ligue1 makes a speedy recovery and that justice is served to the perpetrator of this heinous act.</p>
<h1 id="France-mourns-Casino-shot-Ligue1-as-tragedy-unfolds"><a href="#France-mourns-Casino-shot-Ligue1-as-tragedy-unfolds" class="headerlink" title="France mourns Casino shot Ligue1 as tragedy unfolds"></a>France mourns Casino shot Ligue1 as tragedy unfolds</h1><p>PARIS, France - As the investigation proceeds into who is responsible for the death of French Ligue1 soccer player Daniel Casin, the nation mourns his passing.</p>
<p>Casin, who played for Casino Shot, died Saturday after being shot in the head outside a nightclub in the city of Lyon.</p>
<p>“This is a terrible tragedy,” said Lyon prosecutor Sylvie Petit. “Our thoughts are with Mr. Casin’s family and loved ones.”</p>
<p>Police have not released any information about possible suspects in the case.</p>
<p>Casin, 27, had been with Casino Shot since 2009 and was a key player on the team. He was also a member of the French national team from 2007 to 2010.</p>
<p>“Daniel was an amazing person and an amazing player,” said Casino Shot coach Frédéric Antonetti. “He will be missed by all of us.”</p>
<p>Flags at Casino Shot’s stadium were lowered to half-staff Sunday as fans paid tribute to Casin. A public memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday in Lyon.</p>
<p>The tragedy has rocked France as it prepares for next year’s World Cup. “We are all devastated by this loss,” said French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet. “Daniel was a talented player and a great guy.”</p>
